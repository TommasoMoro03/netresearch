## LauzHack 2025

### Overview
In 24 hours my team (Gabriele Maraglino and Andrea Gentilini) and I developed NetResearch, an agentic AI platform that lets you visualize your personal research network in a custom 3d graph.

N.B. The original project was divided in two separate repositories, you can find them here to see the commit history:
- Frontend: https://github.com/TommasoMoro03/netresearch-frontend
- Backend: https://github.com/TommasoMoro03/netresearch-backend
